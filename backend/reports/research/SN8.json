Revenue is generated by providing high-quality trading signals to end users \u2013 the PTN operates a marketplace where clients can purchase signals, with payments handled via Stripe or PayPal. Additionally, the introduction of the Theta token enables community members to invest in the subnet by swapping TAO for Theta, effectively funding the network\u2019s growth and aligning incentives between traders, users, and token holders.",

As a Bittensor subnet, it uses the network\u2019s miner-validator infrastructure: AI-powered trading signals are produced by miners and validated on-chain by validators in Subnet 8. The subnet leverages Bittensor\u2019s dynamic TAO tokenomics \u2013 its Theta token operates within Bittensor\u2019s framework, allowing value to flow between the TAO main network and the PTN subnetwork. Beyond the Bittensor network, Taoshi has integrated with external platforms: it partnered with Timeless to distribute top trading signals through an external service, and its Glitch platform interfaces directly with users\u2019 exchange/brokerage accounts in a non-custodial manner (users retain control of funds while trades are executed automatically).",

    {
      "question": "Risks or Red Flags",
      "answer": "The main risks identified revolve around the quality and reliability of trading signals. To prevent cheating or duplicate strategies, Taoshi implements a Plagiarism Detection System (PDS) on Subnet 8, ensuring each miner\u2019s signal is unique and fairly rewarded. Risk management is enforced through strict rules; for example, any miner whose strategy draws down more than 10% is eliminated from the network to protect the overall portfolio integrity. The project did undergo a significant pivot in its early stages \u2013 shifting from a general prediction marketplace to focused trading signals \u2013 which led to some miner turnover and a temporary drop in its share of network activity. No major external red flags have been reported to date, but like any emerging network, PTN must continue to prove its long-term stability and its ability to attract and retain top-performing contributors.",

      "question": "Optional Advanced Signals",

As of mid-2025, Theta trades around $22\u201323, with roughly $33 million in liquidity supporting its market. This subnetwork has accounted for approximately 6\u20138% of Bittensor\u2019s total token emissions, reflecting its considerable share of the network\u2019s resources. Looking ahead, Taoshi plans to broaden the scope of its AI-driven predictions: after starting with cryptocurrency market signals (e.g. Bitcoin price trends), the team intends to expand into additional financial markets and even non-financial domains like sports betting and other user-requested prediction tasks.",
