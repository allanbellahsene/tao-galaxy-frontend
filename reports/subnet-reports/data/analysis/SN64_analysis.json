    "I_INVESTMENT_THESIS": {
      "Overall_Investment_Rating": "Buy (4/5) – Strong revenue traction and technical differentiation offset by competitive and anonymity risks",
      "Investment_Thesis_Summary": "Chutes offers a cost-efficient, decentralized serverless AI compute platform with proven revenue streams and enterprise‐grade deployment, positioning it to capture significant share of a $22B+ TAM. Its developer-friendly APIs, 85% cost advantage, and active scaling demonstrate strong execution, though incumbent competition and partial team anonymity warrant caution.",
      "Key_Investment_Strengths": [
        "Established revenue streams from compute usage, API fees, and $40/mo Squad subscriptions (Growth/Scaling phase)",
        "85% cost reduction vs. AWS Lambda and fully decentralized infrastructure with auto-staking incentives",
        "Open-source, professionally managed codebase with hundreds of GPUs processing 5bn+ tokens/day"
      ],
      "Key_Investment_Risks": [
        "Strong competition from AWS, Google, and Azure functions dominating PaaS market share",
        "Partially anonymous team increases execution and governance uncertainty",
        "Developer adoption friction due to blockchain wallet requirements and education needs"
      ]
    },
    
    "II_MARKET_OPPORTUNITY": {
      "Market_Size_Assessment": "Excellent – Serverless compute TAM of $21.9B growing to $44.7–90.9B by 2029–33 implies substantial upside",
      "Market_Timing_Assessment": "Good – Decentralized AI compute is gaining traction but still early relative to established cloud providers",
      "Competitive_Position_Strength": "Strong – 85% cost advantage and decentralized token incentives provide a clear edge versus centralized incumbents",
      "Moat_Assessment": "Moderate – Economic incentives, open-source community and tokenomics create stickiness, but non-blockchain solutions can replicate core features"
    },
    
    "III_EXECUTION_CAPABILITY": {
      "Team_Quality_Rating": "Good – Recognized ecosystem figures (Namoray, BonOliver, Jon Durbin) but partial anonymity limits full due diligence",
      "Development_Momentum_Rating": "High – Regular multi-repo updates, professional CI/testing practices, recent GPU validation and Kubernetes improvements",
      "Community_Engagement_Rating": "Average – Strong GitHub activity but limited broader channel presence (no dedicated Discord/Telegram)",
      "Technical_Innovation_Rating": "Innovative – AI-optimized, serverless on decentralized infrastructure with auto-staking and revenue-sharing differentiators"
    },
    
    "IV_FINANCIAL_VIABILITY": {
      "Revenue_Potential_Assessment": "High – Diverse streams from compute micropayments, subscriptions, API fees, and platform integrations",
      "Monetization_Clarity_Rating": "Clear – TAO micropayments and subscription pricing already in place with growing user base",
      "Business_Model_Sustainability": "Sustainable – Recurring subscription and usage fees backed by developer ecosystem and tokenomics",
      "Product_Market_Fit_Stage": "Achieved – Production-scale deployment with hundreds of GPUs and billions of tokens processed daily"
    },
    
    "V_RISK_ASSESSMENT": {
      "Technical_Risk_Level": "Medium – Robust dev practices but decentralized reliability and wallet integration pose challenges",
      "Market_Risk_Level": "Medium – Large TAM but intense competition from well-capitalized incumbents",
      "Team_Risk_Level": "Medium – Experienced core founders but partial anonymity elevates governance/execution uncertainty",
      "Regulatory_Risk_Level": "Low – Serverless compute regulation is minimal; blockchain tokenomics may incur future compliance scrutiny",
      "Competition_Risk_Level": "High – AWS/GCP/Azure dominance and rapid innovation in centralized PaaS threaten share"
    },
    
    "VI_COMPARATIVE_METRICS": {
      "Development_Activity_Percentile": "Top 25% – Regular multi-repo contributions and professional tooling exceed average subnet activity",
      "Team_Quality_Percentile": "Top 50% – Known ecosystem leaders but anonymity prevents elite-tier confidence",
      "Market_Opportunity_Percentile": "Top 25% – Addresses a large and growing serverless computing market",
      "Innovation_Level_Percentile": "Top 25% – Unique decentralized, token-incentivized serverless AI offering"

      "Key_Milestones_to_Watch": [
        "Release of a detailed public technical roadmap and governance model",
        "Partnerships or integrations with major AI frameworks beyond DeepSeek/Mistral",
        "Sustained growth in daily compute volume and Squad subscription metrics"
      ],
      "Exit_Triggers": [
        "Failure to maintain ≥85% cost advantage vs. AWS leading to pricing erosion",
        "Major security or reliability incident undermining decentralized performance",
        "Key founders departing or shift to anonymity increasing governance risk"
