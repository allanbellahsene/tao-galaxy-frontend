# TAO Galaxy ‚Äî Core Context for Research Agent

This document provides essential background to help the Research Agent understand the Bittensor ecosystem, the role of subnets, the dTAO mechanism, and TAO Galaxy's purpose.

## üß† What is Bittensor?

Bittensor is a decentralized network that incentivizes the development of useful artificial intelligence. It is often referred to as the "Bitcoin of Intelligence."

### Key Features:
- **Subnets**: Independent AI modules that run on the network and compete for rewards (TAO emissions).
- **Yuma Consensus**: A reputation-based consensus mechanism that ranks the performance of subnet participants.
- **TAO Token**: The native token of the network, used to incentivize useful computation.

Each subnet is effectively its own mini-network focused on solving a specific problem, such as language modeling, image classification, trading strategies, or validation.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Does Bittensor Work?

1. **Subnet Creation**: Anyone can create a subnet by burning TAO.
2. **Staking**: Delegators stake TAO on subnets they believe will perform well.
3. **Mining & Validation**: Participants (miners/validators) provide value (e.g., AI services) and are ranked via Yuma Consensus.
4. **Emission Distribution**: TAO emissions are distributed across subnets based on performance. Each subnet distributes TAO among its own miners, validators, and delegators.

## üîÅ Subnet Economics

- Every subnet has its own "alpha token," denominated in TAO.
- The **price of a subnet** = amount of TAO staked to it / circulating supply of its alpha token.
- The **price** determines how much emission the subnet receives. The higher the price, the larger its share of TAO emissions.

This mechanism creates **constant demand for TAO**:
- Subnets need staked TAO to receive emissions.
- Delegators buy TAO to stake to subnets they believe in.
- Teams burn TAO to create subnets.

## üß¨ What is dTAO?

dTAO is an updated protocol layer introduced in early 2024. It introduces:
- Permissionless subnet registration with TAO burn.
- Decentralized emission redistribution based on market-driven subnet performance.
- Improved flexibility for how subnets can define their logic and objectives.

Subnets operate more like startups or services with TAO emissions as their primary revenue.

## üåå What is TAO Galaxy?

TAO Galaxy is an independent platform that helps investors and researchers:
- **Discover** and understand Bittensor subnets.
- **Track** their performance, fundamentals, and updates.
- **Evaluate** them using structured, AI-generated research and scoring.

TAO Galaxy simplifies and organizes the otherwise scattered information landscape of Bittensor. This becomes increasingly important as the number of subnets grows rapidly.

## üß© Your Role as Research Agent

You will use this document as foundational context to:
- Understand how the ecosystem functions.
- Prioritize what matters when analyzing subnets (team, product, roadmap, incentives, emissions).
- Ensure factual alignment with how TAO and dTAO mechanics actually work.

Use this to cross-check any ambiguous or unclear claims when reviewing subnets.
